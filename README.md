# invaders

Clojurescript port of Mary Rose Cook's Space Invaders livecode talk - https://vimeo.com/105955605 and https://github.com/maryrosecook/annotated-code/tree/master/space-invaders

## Setup in repl

```
(use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api) (start-figwheel!) (cljs-repl)
```

## Setup outside repl

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
